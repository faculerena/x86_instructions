# The CPU usage game
[Repo](https://github.com/faculerena/cpu-usage-game)

This "game" was born when `rustc` made my pc so slow that
even [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) was slow.

## The idea

If sometimes the CPU is at >99% and the games became slow, what is the impediment to make a game that when your CPU is being _really_ used, it goes FASTER? This is just a [Paperclip Maximizer](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/squiggle-maximizer-formerly-paperclip-maximizer) or Cookie Clicker (i.e., an idle game) that goes faster (linearly) with your CPU usage.

## Why?

```rust
todo!()
```
